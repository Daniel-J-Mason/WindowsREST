You can click and drag the exe to your task bar to pin it.

Basic use notes:
Search bars are self explanatory, you can use 000000, 000000d, 000000D to pull a part number.
You do not need to press the search button, you can simply press enter.

Truck searchbars will autocomplete. You MUST use the full filename for this to work correctly so you must double click Enter to autocomplete then search.

All truck names + locations are compiled when the application is launched, if you have left it open and need to search units that have been uploaded recently, click refresh to get the new truck names added to the autcomplete list.

Clear all panels declutters each panel and removes all error labels.
